  "articleBody": "** WARNING ** The following post contains images of neglect.\nThose of a nervous disposition should read no further.\nMore Pac-Man joy Many years ago I chipped in to the first ever UK Kickstarter, the Picade from Pimoroni, so old it was powered by a RaspberryPi Model B; I decided to dig it out of the cupboard of forgotten tech, dust it off and start refurbishing it.\nBits and pieces used RaspberryPi 3\nPac-Man imagery by @Wheelhorse from this mega-thread and vinyl printed by a local printer Illuminated buttons and joystick ball\nHowever I probably ordered too many buttons…\nPicade loom (Edit: no longer stocked)\nThe sturdier wiring on the new loom is a lot less fragile than the original KickStarter loom\nOn/Off Shim A couple of reasons to add one of these nifty boards, more details further down\nMomentary Push Switch Then main reason to add one of these was to simplify the powering-down process. I also needed one to fit a pre-drilled hole in the rear of the cabinet\nShiny Trim (Edit: no longer stocked)\nFor bling !\n6mm and 12mm cable tidy because I like tidy\nWire and crimps for wiring harnesses because I needed to make some adjustments to where the power went to\nPatience, and I mean lots of patience\nTake one dusty, neglected Picade in need of refurbishing It’s looking a little forlorn but elbow grease and chemicals will help; it’s time for a transformation.\nA Dusty Front View of a Picade\nNot exactly a good advertisement for my dusting skills but it does show that an update is long overdue.\nA Dusty Rear View of a Picade\nOh look, an ancient RaspberryPi Model B but in an original Pimoroni Pibow.\nI’m going to take this opportunity to upgrade that too but first everything needs disassembling.\nAnother Dusty Rear View of a Picade\nAlso, I’m sure there were creatures living in there.\nIt’s amazing how much dust actually collects in there even though it has been living in a cupboard.\nA Dusty Inside View of a Picade\nYou can also see the ghostly outlines of long dead cables.\n(And a possible dead creature carcass next to the middle screw terminal on the left.)\nAnother Dusty Inside View of a Picade\nFirst ablutions Shiny, you can almost see your reflection in there (but not quite).\nHowever, it’s amazing what hot soapy water, some sugar soap and WD40 can do.\nClean Inside View of a Picade\nI even took the Pibow apart and cleaned that otherwise it would have looked incongruous.\nHowever, it turns out that was a pointless exercise as the new RaspberryPi wouldn’t fit into the old Pibow.\nClean Rear View\nAt this point everything still worked.\nThe screen was lit and the Pi was booting.\nBut there was still that strange buzzing sound.\nSo I decided to reflash RetroPie .\nStill no joy, still buzzing.\nSo I decided to update and flash the firmware, MacGyver style.\nRaspi Rats Nest\nOops.\nOf course I borked the firmware.\nSo, time to disassemble completely, clean again, and give my Picade a fresh coat of LED and vinyl love.\nSecond ablutions After complete disassembly, much sugar-soap and WD40 the MDF was looking in better shape.\nClean MDF Parts\nCutting the Pac-Man vinyl for the case I had decided to vinyl wrap the Picade.\nThat however, was a mixed blessing.\nThe Pac-Man wrap looked fantastic but cutting all of the pieces by hand was a chore.\nPac-Man Vinyl Side View\nIt looks fantastic but I can’t emphasise enough how much of a chore this was.\nVinyl Pac-Man Bezel and Controls\nIf I ever do this again, I’d opt for contour cutting to save a few hours.\n(But that would have driven up the cost quite dramatically.)\nVinyl \u0026 MDF Pac-Man Side View\nReassembly I reassembled the carcass without a hitch.\nI’m not sure about cutting out the crenels though.\nI’m undecided whether I like this look or not.\nStarting Cabinet Reassembly\nThe marquee is looking good (more about this later).\nStarting Marquee Reassembly\nI even managed to not break the screen whilst disassembling, cleaning and reassembling.\nReassembled Cabinet\nAdding an ‘On-Off Shim’ to the RaspberryPi There are a couple of reasons I added an ‘On/Off Shim’:\nA neat button that performs a clean shutdown\nA way of running the 5V power and ground looms to the LED buttons\nOn/Off Shim\nAlso, ‘Hot Glue’ is related to ‘WD40’ and ‘Gaffer Tape’, right?\nOn/Off Shim in Place\nButton wiring – part 1 Wiring up the LED power and ground looms first.\nAlso, it’s a good job the anode was painted or else I’d never have figured out how to wire the four terminals up.\nFor reference:\nThis is a ‘Picade Maxi’, so has 8 buttons on top.\n6 x Blue buttons for the arcade controls\n2 x red buttons for the volume controls\nTidy Button Wiring\nPicade first boot! Not doing any more wiring unless the damn thing boots !\nI’m keen to start playing some Pac-Man but I really need to make sure that it boots OK.\nFirst Boot !\nButton wiring – part 2 Connecting up the buttons to the Picade control board.\nButton Wiring Close Up\nPicade cable tidy The cable tidy proved to be a mixed blessing.\nWhilst it kept everything tidy it also introduced a slight amount of resistance to the bound wires.\nThat meant that I had to take a bit of care when affixing the console to the cabinet to ensure that the tidied bundles of wires were positioned correctly and not pressing on the underside of the illuminated buttons as this inhibited the button action.\nConsole Wiring\nTesting the buttons Those wires hanging over the top of the cabinet are where the +/-5V from the ‘On/Off Shim’ has been broken out into three separate strands.\nOne strand is for the the eight buttons on the top of the console\nOne strand is for the side and front buttons if they are ever swapped for LED buttons\nThe third strand is to potentially power an illuminated marquee if I ever get around to that\nButton Test\nBreaking out the power (Before being wired up and squished into the cabinet.)\nI deleiberately added extra power strands as I plan in the future to add even more LED goodness.\nOn/Off Shim In Rear Door\nEverything works, so change it All booting and working.\nSo, time to tinker.\nBoot With Buttons Lit\nPicade button swapping I swapped out the yellow buttons for LED ones.\n(Actually, I broke one of the yellow lugs that hold the button in place.)\nSo, all I needed to do was make a positive daisy-chain and a ground daisy-chain.\nThen wire those to the already broken out +/-5V from the ‘On/Off Shim’.\nYou can just about make out the daisy-chain, covered in cable-tidy before it heads off under the screen to the Shim.\nChanging To Yellow Lit Buttons\nPicade rear wiring Lots of tidy cables here, it took a bit of time but I think it was worth it.\nWiring View From The Rear\nI just about manage to fit all of that extra plastic in.\nEven though it looks pretty, I wouldn’t do it again because:\nIt was time consuming\nIt added unnecessary resistance to the loops of wires\nAnother Wiring View From The Rear\nFinishing up I went through updating the firmware ; without breaking anything this time.\nI managed to sort out the sound.\nAnd that was pretty much it, everything else worked straight away, out of the box.\nThe finished Picade with unlit buttons Looks good now that it’s all finished and the trim is in place.\nNot sure how long the trim will stay stuck for though, it doesn’t seem super sticky.\n(Edit: I had to eventually superglue the trim in place as it lifted over time.)\nCompleted Unlit Front View\nI made a conscious decision to leave the black buttons in place.\nThey just look right next to the yellow vinyl.\nSide view of the refurbished Picade Completed Unlit Side View\nSpace-Invaders detail on the refurbished Picade I do love the ‘Space Invader’ detail on the rear.\nCompleted Unlit Rear View\nIt looks good from the back with the ‘Invader’ lit.\nCompleted Lit Rear View\nSome of those Picade buttons don’t look OK The button stickers are lifting slightly.\nI know these buttons are a few millimeters less in diameter than the originals.\nThey are also slightly more convex.\nEtching, instead of stickers may be in order.\nCompleted Unlit Console View\nThe lifting stickers are not too noticeable once the power is on.\nCompleted Lit Console View\nThe yellow illuminated buttons next to the graphics by @Wheelhorse look fantastic.\nCompleted Lit Console Front View\nGratuitous Picade glamour shots after the overhaul Still unsure about those cutaways.\nIf I had to revamp this thing again I’d think about covering the crenelations but that might remove some of the ‘home-made’ charm so I’m not sure.\nCompleted Lit Side View\nAll work was overseen by Professor Screwed.\nCompleted Lit Front View\nAnother shot of the front.\nAnother Completed Lit Front View\nAnd yet another…\nYet Another Completed Lit Front View\nIt is a bit of a transformation but took quite a bit of time.\nBut it does actually work properly now !\nCompleted Lit Side View\nNext steps Load it full of games and then play Pac-Man obviously.\nPlay even more than ‘Pac-Man’ on it !!!\nThings I’d do differently Cough up the extra cash and get the vinyl contour cut next time My poor knife skills are not too noticeable, however I know the mistakes are there.\nCompleted Bad Knife Skills\nCut with more care The image insert needs to extend to the end of the marquee and then it would be a perfect fit.\nMy mistake, but not a biggie and if I add lights up there it’ll need to be opaque anyway.\nCompleted Marquee Short Banner\nNot use unnecessary cable tidy No matter however tidy it all looks.\nDon’t buy cheap tools from Amazon They are a false economy however quickly they get delivered.\n(I’m looking at you crimping tool.)\nFuture Picade mods Because nothing is every truly finished.\nIlluminated Marquee. I’ll probably run the remaining +/-5V from the Shim to a set of lights behind the marquee but for now I’m done tinkering.\nMote. I will find a use for those Mote strips I have in a box somewhere and then there will be even more LED goodness.\nEtched buttons. The stickers will come off, probably sooner rather than later, so I think I’m going to etch them.\nFinished (?) I thinks that’s all for now but you never know when inspiration will strike!\n",

<p>Many years ago I chipped in to the first ever UK Kickstarter, the Picade from Pimoroni, so old it was powered by a RaspberryPi Model B; I decided to dig it out of the cupboard of forgotten tech, dust it off and start refurbishing it.</p>

<p>I even took the Pibow apart and cleaned that otherwise it would have looked incongruous.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that was a pointless exercise as the new RaspberryPi wouldn’t fit into the old Pibow.</p>

<p>At this point everything still worked.</p>
<p>The screen was lit and the Pi was booting.</p>
<p>But there was still that strange buzzing sound.</p>
<p>So I decided to reflash 

<a href="https://retropie.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">RetroPie</a>

<p>Still no joy, still buzzing.</p>
<p>So I decided to update and flash the firmware, MacGyver style.</p>

<p>I had decided to vinyl wrap the Picade.</p>

<p>The Pac-Man wrap looked fantastic but cutting all of the pieces by hand was a chore.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons I added an ‘On/Off Shim’:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A neat button that performs a clean shutdown</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A way of running the 5V power and ground looms to the LED buttons</p>

<p>The cable tidy proved to be a mixed blessing.</p>
<p>Whilst it kept everything tidy it also introduced a slight amount of resistance to the bound wires.</p>
<p>That meant that I had to take a bit of care when affixing the console to the cabinet to ensure that the tidied bundles of wires were positioned correctly and not pressing on the underside of the illuminated buttons as this inhibited the button action.</p>

<p>Those wires hanging over the top of the cabinet are where the +/-5V from the ‘On/Off Shim’ has been broken out into three separate strands.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>One strand is for the side and front buttons if they are ever swapped for LED buttons</p>

<p>Then wire those to the already broken out +/-5V from the ‘On/Off Shim’.</p>
